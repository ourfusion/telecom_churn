# telecom_churn
The churn rate is most commonly known as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period (usually monthly). For a company to expand its clients, its growth rate (the number of new customers) must exceed its churn rate. 

The churn rate not only includes when customers switch carriers, but it also includes when customers terminate service without switching. This measurement is most valuable in subscriber-based businesses in which subscription fees comprise most of the revenues. Churn rate is an important factor in the telecommunications industry. Many of these companies compete, making it easy for people to transfer from one provider to another. Research has shown that the average monthly churn rate among the top 4 telecom companies in the US is 1.9% - 2%. 

In this business case the churn, one of the biggest problem in the telecom industry, is analysed by visualizing the given dataset to provide a clear view on this matter to the CEO, Sales Manager and Sales team of the company. Based on this top-down analysis, the detailes of demonstrated data are increased from CEO to Sales team to find a clear answer to this question that why churn is happening in our telecom company?
